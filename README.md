# pglife
PGLife is a locally hosted website that enables distant students to obtain housing in the form of hostels, dorms, or paying guests.
The service offers a simple location shortlisting search for lodging in relevant cities and regions. In order for the website to assist you with the shortlisting, it also gives you the option to create an account with your data. You can even "like" particular PGs to put them to your list of potential future reviews.
Useful text stacks included are:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript for the front-end
PHP is used for the back end.
MySQL, the database
And still thinking to add more features into it.
